# StreamJSONParser

StreamJSONParser is a JavaScript module that provides a way to parse JSON data from a readable stream in an asynchronous and efficient manner. It is particularly useful when dealing with streaming JSON data, such as data received from server-sent events (SSE) or other real-time data sources.

## Installation

You can install StreamJSONParser using npm or yarn:

```shell
npm install stream-json-parser
```

or

```shell
yarn add stream-json-parser
```

## Usage

To use StreamJSONParser, you need to import it into your JavaScript or TypeScript code:

```javascript
import streamJSONParser from 'stream-json-parser';
```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use StreamJSONParser to parse JSON data from a readable stream:

```javascript
import streamJSONParser from 'stream-json-parser';

// Create a ReadableStream (e.g., from a fetch response)
const response = await fetch('https://example.com/streaming-data');
const stream = response.body;

for await (const chunk of streamjsonparser(response.body)) {
                console.log(chunk)
            }
```

### How It Works

The `streamJSONParser` function accepts a readable stream as its input and returns an asynchronous generator that yields parsed JSON objects as they are received from the stream.
